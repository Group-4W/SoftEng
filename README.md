     - Use case diagrams (mandatory)

     - State diagrams

     - Class diagrams (mandatory)

     - User flow diagrams

 ▪ Rough designs of the screens (pages) that your application will have and how these flow together. We are looking for wireframes and a high-level overview of how the application flows together.
