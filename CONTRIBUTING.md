# Coding Style

The coding style should be familiar across the board, this means indentions where its needed and comments where necessary.

Example:

```
 <script>
    document.write("Hello"); # Note the indentions, this keeps the code organised
 </script>
 ```


# Only make issues when they are necessary and there is an actual problem

Ignoring the first issue to ever exist on this repo (as its an example), you should make sure that when you post an issue that it expresses an actual problem or bug in the code

Examples would be typos, errors, incorrect indentions, etc

# Pull Requests

Make sure your Pull Requests don't conflict, this means make sure that you have updated your cloned repository to the latest version of the branch and your new commits are adding on top of that.
